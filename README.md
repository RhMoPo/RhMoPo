## üöÄ About Me
With a rich tapestry of experience spanning law, business management, entrepreneurship, and coding, I am far from your typical software engineer. My legal training honed my meticulous problem-solving skills, while my studies in business management and Mandarin across Taiwan's dynamic landscapes enhanced my adaptability and cross-cultural expertise. Owning a business taught me to navigate precarious situations, transforming challenges into victories with a dash of creativity. More recently, my coding journey at the School of Code has ignited a fresh passion. I am thrilled to integrate these varied experiences into a vibrant career in software engineering, seamlessly merging fun and functionality in every line of code!

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact: The username I use on GitHub is actually a play on my full name, Rhys Montgomery Postans!

    <td>Guess the word from its phonetic transcription. Use hints with dictionary definitions to help!</td>
    <td>This project began about three weeks into the School of Code. Initially, it wasn't designed as a formal project; rather, I simply wanted to experiment with some free APIs after learning how to make API calls using JavaScript. While examining the JSON response from a dictionary API, I noticed it included phonetics, which swiftly led to the creation of the basic concept for this game, where users are presented with a phonetic representation and must guess the corresponding word. Eager to avoid creating my own word database, I sought another API to automate the word generation process. Although this second API was not perfect due to compatibility issues between the two APIs, I managed to make it work. Additionally, this project became a valuable tool to implement and reinforce what I learned each week, helping to solidify my understanding and put my new skills into practice.<br><br>

    <td>This project involves a system designed to streamline the process of decoding messages that are written in a secret language I created with a friend.</td>
    <td>The main motivation for creating this project was the increasing amount of time it took to decode our growing encrypted chats. I wanted to continue enjoying the unique and private nature of our communication without the growing burden of manual decoding. By devising a secretive decoding method, I could maintain the enjoyment and pace of our conversations, ensuring that the fun of our secret language didn't turn into a chore.<br><br>*|```**_|*::|*_|_|*|```*_|```||*::**|::_|*_::|*|_|_|*_|```||**|_*|_|_|*_|```||*|```*_::|*_|```|*|```*|/\_|*|::_|**</td>
